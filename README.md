# Image-Colorisation
We first revised Python. Then we did the first 6 weeks of a Machine learning course by Andrews Ng on Coursea. Implemented Linear Regression algorithm to find the line of best fit for a given sample of points. For neural networks we refered to the book 'Neural Networks and Deep Lerning'. Then we learnt about CNNs through a blog. We learnt about the pytorch library through the pytorch tutorials on pytorch.org . We watched a youtube playlist of NPTEL-IITM on CNN architecture.We read a paper on GANs and Implemented it on MNIST handwritten digits dataset. Then we read a paper on DCGAN and implemented it. Finally we implemented a paper on Pix2Pix GAN.
