# Image-Colorisation
We first revised Python. Then we did the first 6 weeks of a Machine learning course by Andrews Ng on Coursea. For neural networks we refered to the book 'Neural Networks and Deep Lerning'. Then we learnt about CNNs through a blog. We learnt about the pytorch library through the pytorch tutorials on pytorch.org . Currently we are watching a youtube playlist of NPTEL-IITM on CNN architecture.
